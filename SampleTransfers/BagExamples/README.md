# Bag transfer type examples

This sample data enables the testing of Bags within Archivematica. Bags are
separated into Unzipped Bags and Zipped Bags. Depending on the feature being
tested there may not be a one-to-one mapping between the content of Unzipped
vs. Zipped bags, though it does make good test practice to create a zipped
version of all standard bags where possible.
