Staffing for Effective Digital Preservation 2017: An NDSA Report

Scope of Study
Summary: Organizations establishing or scaling up digital preservation programs are faced with many staffing, scoping and organizational decisions. Some of the questions that need to be answered include: How many staff are needed and what kinds of skills, education and experience should they have? What types of positions should the institution create? Should it hire new staff or retrain existing staff? And how should the preservation program be scoped--that is, what functions should be included directly in the program, provided by other parts of the organization, outsourced, or implemented through collaboration with other organizations? What organizational and staffing models work well?

In 2012, several members of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) Standards & Practices working group discovered that they shared a common interest in knowing how organizations were staffing and organizing digital preservation programs. The 2012 Preservation Staffing Survey, and resulting paper conducted and written by members of the NDSA Standards & Practices working group, was designed to shed light on how organizations responsible for digital preservation are addressing these staffing, scoping and organizational questions.

 In 2017, the interested members of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) repeated the survey to gain insight into how organizations worldwide were addressing these questions five years later. Such information is useful for benchmarking, identifying effective practices, and possibly making a case to strengthen staffing. Survey respondents were asked to describe their organization type (library, archives, data repository, etc.), how much storage they were using for digital content, expected growth in preserved content over the next year, which types of activities were considered part of the scope of the digital preservation function, which activities were outsourced, whether there was a dedicated digital preservation department, how many FTEs were currently doing digital preservation work and how many would be ideal, which functions the digital preservation staff filled, whether the staffing arrangement worked well, whether the organization hired experienced digital preservation specialists or retrained existing staff, and the importance of various skills in hiring a new digital preservation manager. 

The survey received responses from 14 unique countries, including the United States. The eleven options for repository type we provided were each represented. We also received additional responses in the free-text section that could constitute additional repository types.  

Survey Overview

Geographic Coverage: Global
Time Period: March 7, 2017 – April 18, 2017
Date of Collection: March 7, 2017 - April 18, 2017
Unit of Observation: Organization
Universe: Organizations around the world responsible for digital preservation
Data Type: survey data
Sample:  Institutions answering the survey responded to announcements distributed via the listservs and Web sites of these organizations: National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA); Conservation DistList; (ALA) Association for Library Collections & Technical Services--Preservation and Reformatting Section; (ALA) Association for College and Research Libraries--Digital Curation Interest Group; (ALA) Library and Information Technology; Association for Information Science and Technology--Digital Libraries Special Interest Group;  Digital Library Federation; State Electronic Records Initiative; Digital Curation Google Group; Digital Preservation Outreach and Education Program; Society of American Archivists; International Council on Archives; Digital Preservation; Digital Library Forum; Digital Curation Centre; International Federation of Library Associations--Preservation and Conservation Section; National Coalition Digital Preservation; and Research Data Access & Preservation. Data were collected at the institutional level, with no control from the NDSA regarding who within an institution completed the survey.

Mode of Data collection: Internet survey, fielded and analyzed using Qualtrics software.
Response Rate: The survey was started 160 times and completed 133 times for an 83% completion rate.
Restrictions: Data were collected at the institutional level, with no control from the NDSA regarding who within an institution completed the survey.

Data Preparation
We conducted the survey using an instance of Qualtrics survey software (http://www.qualtrics.com/) hosted at Duke University. At the end of the survey period, we exported the survey questions and responses for analysis to prepare them for deposit in the Center for Open Science's Open Science Framework (OSF). 

Format:
*    The responses were exported in the CSV and SPSS SAV formats. 
*    If a respondent either quit the survey or chose not to answer a question, that decision was recorded with an empty cell or the “-99” value. An empty cell typically meant that the question was formatted for text input, while the “-99” value indicated that the unanswered question was seen but not answered, and formatted for a numeric response.
 
Completion status:
*    The archived data includes all 168 responses, whether or not the respondent completed the survey. Column G's True/False response allows users easily to determine which responses are complete.
*    Note: Qualtrics defines “completed” to mean, “The Survey’s Completed number is the number of surveys submitted by respondents, meaning that the respondent was screened out of the survey or reached the final page and hit the Submit button. This number does not include anyone who did not submit a survey.” We did not screen any respondents out of this survey. 
 
Removing Potentially Identifying information:
*    We have deleted responses from Questions 2, 21, and 22. We retained the text for those questions in this codebook. 
*    Reviewing the remaining responses showed that some identifying information remained. IP addresses had not been deleted and some free-text comments included potentially identifying information, particularly Question 13. We have reviewed those responses and indicated any additional deletions. 

Files Deposited: 
*    (Code Book) NDSA_DigitalPreservationStaffingSurvey2017CodeBook.txt 
*    (Data) StaffingSurveyAnonymousData.csv 
    
The CSV format provides ready access to the data and does not require specialized software.  

Notes on Survey Formatting
1: Qualtrics numbers questions in the order they were created, rather than the order in which they appear. The order in which questions are displayed in this document is correct. 
2: Questions with an asterisk between the question number and question text (e.g., Q2 * What is the name of your organization?) were mandatory.
3: Categories in matrix questions (numbers 8, 28, and 18) each have a series of asterisks ( * * * * ) that identifies the number of cells in the matrix grid.  

[Questions]

Q30    NDSA Digital Preservation Staffing Survey, 2017 Download a Microsoft Word version of the survey here. 

Q1 Initiated within the Standards and Practices Interest Group, members of the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA) based this survey on one created in 2012 to assess current and anticipated staffing needs. Data collected from this survey will provide a more recent perspective of digital preservation staffing needs and of how perspectives have changed since the 2012 survey and report.          

This survey is intended for organizations that are currently responsible for digital preservation, whether that responsibility is fulfilled in-house or outsourced to a commercial, nonprofit, or consortial provider.  It will be used to understand current and ideal practice in staffing digital preservation programs. (We encourage participation from all types of organizations and you do not need to be a member of NDSA to complete this survey).     

Only one response should be submitted per organization. All questions are optional unless otherwise noted.     We will make our best effort to protect your individual survey responses so that no one will be able to connect your responses with you or your organization. Any personal information that could identify you or your organization will be removed or changed before results are made public. We will combine your responses with the responses of others and make the aggregated results public, and preserve the anonymous data long-term for research purposes. Please email any questions to ndsastaffingsurvey2016@googlegroups.com with the subject line “Staffing Survey.”     

The NDSA’s institutional home is the Digital Library Federation (DLF), at the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). If you would like to learn about the NDSA, including how your institution can become a member, please see the NDSA web site.
