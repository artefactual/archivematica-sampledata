We have one cataloger that does cataloging for all collections at our organization.  We outsource our servers/storage but our 1 in-house network specialist was laid off last year, so we are short on IT support, no programmer in sight either.  Would love to have 1 digital preservation manager managing a team and all of the other positions would be focused on a specific job, but should be able to work across the group for core tasks.  2 positions working on appraisal/ingest/workflow, metadata; 1 person with some programming experience to help automate some of the tasks where we don't currently have tools. This might be able to be combined with someone to manage the repository software. All these positions could participate in policy development and documentation of processes and procedures, metadata extraction, some training to groups, working with other functions that already exist here within the organization (cataloging, rights management) as needed. At least a .5 FTE would be great for outreach to contributors / training but a full FTE would be better. The Digital Manager would manage staff, projects coming in, outreach, probably some budgeting and have a solid understanding of each of the staff's positions/tasks - also important would be be involved at the national level in groups like SAA, NDSA, CoSA, NAGARA, ARMA, NASCIO, etc to stay abreast of what's going on in the larger world.

In my opinion, one of the crucial problems facing digital preservation efforts is the fact that a familiarity with digital preservation standards and best practices is not the same as the practical IT skillset (programming and systems administration) necessary to implement a working digital preservation system. At my own job, I have had to assume an increasing share of systems administration responsibilities in order to keep our digital repository up and running.\n\nThe discourse around digital preservation often seems to me to take for granted the assumption that digital preservationists, as administrators and standards experts, will be able to delegate the \"grunt work\" of implementing (often quite complex) models and standards to dedicated IT staff. This may be the case in (for example) academic research libraries which have their own dedicated IT unit reporting to a library administrator, and in heritage organizations whose mission encompasses long-term preservation of cultural heritage material, but it is often not the case in institutions whose organization does not fit this model, such as small/local/under-resourced historical societies or (as in my own case) institutional archives which serve an ancillary function to a larger organization whose primary goals are not related to preservation.\n\nWhile this situation has improved over the past decade -- there is an increasingly robust and diverse private-sector vendor market and a growing emphasis (i.e., the POWRR project) on practical, \"can-do\" solutions as opposed to all-encompassing but unrealizable theoretical models -- I still believe that more attention should be paid by educators and funders to the practicalities of implementing complex technical solutions with limited resources."
