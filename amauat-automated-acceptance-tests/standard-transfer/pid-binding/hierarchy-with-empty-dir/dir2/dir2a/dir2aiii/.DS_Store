This is not a real .DS_Store file. This was put here on purpose because
Archivematica should delete this file when creating a transfer from the root
directory hierarchy-with-empty-dir/. See clientScripts/removeUnneededFiles.py
and MCPClient/lib/settings/common.py. As a result, the directory
hierarchy-with-empty-dir/dir2/dir2a/dir2aiii/ should be empty by the time the
assignUUIDsToDirectories.py client script gets to it. This state of affairs is
necessary in order to automate the testing of Archivematica's behaviour related
to empty directories.
